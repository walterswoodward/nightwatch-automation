# Getting Started
* In terminal window/tab run `npm test` to run all tests
  * The test will automatically run an instance of the selenium standalone server before intializing the actual test files
  * Each test suite is located in the `tests` folder [TODO_write_docs_on_tests]
* You can find log files for the selenium server in the `server_logs` folder and any test logs in the `results` folder
* Try writing some new tests using the NightWatchJS guide for developers: http://nightwatchjs.org/guide/!
