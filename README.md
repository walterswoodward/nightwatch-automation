# Getting Started
* In terminal window/tab run `npm test`
* The test will automatically run an instance of the selenium standalone server before intializing the actual test files. Once tests have begin, each test will run [TODO_write_docs_on_tests].
* You can find log files for the selenium server in the `server_logs` folder and any test logs in the `results` folder.
* Try writing some new tests using the nightwatchjs guide for developers: http://nightwatchjs.org/guide/!
